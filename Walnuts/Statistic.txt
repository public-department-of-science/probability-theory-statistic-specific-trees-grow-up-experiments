05.2022 - was planted 1 walnut tree on the lake that I cleaned up on those days for the polution by plastic etc.
09.2023 - That tree adopted in wild nature, but the growing process is so weak according to competition with different spicies of trees and grasses  for water and sun light.
Biological deseases as well take their place to try kill or parasitise on the tree, but nothing critical.
