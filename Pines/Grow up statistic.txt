 - 2021 (spring) were collected sids from pines (around 20 pcs)
 -> successful grow up number was 3 out of 20 that is close to ~15%, but the number is very small for experiment
 
 - 2006-2013 were planted around half of 0.5L bottle of pines seeds
 -> grow up number was 5 out of thousands seeds
 -> and in result were left only 3 pines length:
 --> 1 - around 0.15m (cutted by unknown creature)
 --> 2 - around 0.3m (cutted by unknown creature)
 --> 3 - more that 1m grow size (cutted by unknown creature)
