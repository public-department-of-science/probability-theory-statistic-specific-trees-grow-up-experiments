 - planted during the 2022 (spring):
 -> 37 plants when succesfull grow up number only 4 plants (~10.8%)
 --> 4 big bushes (already on 2022 autumn) growing very fast around on present in wild (forest) nature
 --> 2 big bushes died after cold winter
 --> only 2 out of 37 plants keep growing on 07.2023, but 1 out of these 2 was cutted to the root = maybe will regenerate with next summer.

* mainly black berries provided very low grow up rate 1 (2) out of 37 plants in reason of pure light in the forest and weak roots to survive after wet and even not so cold winter.
* many blackberry bushes were just eat by ants
* only 2 were cut to the down by people

--------------------------------------------------
As result I received 0.02-0.05 chance of surviving a blackberry bush in Black forest of Ukraine that was planted in spring time and with normal watering of the ground level. That experiment have lack of big range of the plants set and not full-gathered growing condition and can't be fully trusted.
