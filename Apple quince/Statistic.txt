12.2021 - was planted by me a fruit tree (apple quince) on the lake I only started to clean. That was warm december and I had a tree at home.
After almost 2 years I can say that the tree is growing up, but so slow as that was observed by me on others groups of trees.
The reason I see for slow growing is - super high competion rate for water and sun light in the wild nature. 
Definitely that one of the trees I ever planted and that wanted to stay alive more than others,
cause the condition were so extremal for growing and this one still green.

Want to stay alive - compete.
